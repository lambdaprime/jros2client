/**
 * Example covers how to use jrosclient for Subscriber and Publisher to same topic
 * inside single application.
 * 
 * <p>Each instance of {@link JRos2Client} creates a new RTPS participant, which starts to listen
 * certain RTPS ports. Currently {@link JRos2Client} does not allow same RTPS participant to
 * publish and subscribe to same topic at the same time. Instead, both Subscriber and Publisher
 * need to run under different participants. To achieve this, two separate instances of {@link JRos2Client}
 * can be used as shown in this example.
 * 
 * <p>By default, subscriber always runs on its own thread after it was subscribed with
 * {@link JRosClient#subscribe(String, Class, java.util.concurrent.Flow.Subscriber)}.
 * Which means, it is possible on same thread run Publisher and then register Subscriber as shown in the example.
